			<p>The first Mega Man game—released in 1987—was not successful enough to justify the immediate development of a sequel.[12] According to Roy Ozaki, director Akira Kitamura had wanted to make a sequel to Mega Man, but producer Tokuro Fujiwara was against it.[13] Kitamura then went to Capcom Vice-President to get permission to make the game.[14] Capcom allowed the development team to create a sequel on the condition that they work concurrently on other projects as well.[11][15][16] The staff spent their own time on the project to improve upon the original by adding more levels and weapons, as well as improving the graphics.[12] The project supervisor of the first Mega Man invited Inafune to the sequel's development crew; Inafune was working on a separate game at the time.[2] In the previous title, Inafune worked as an artist and character designer but became more involved in the production process of the sequel.[17] "Working on [Mega Man 2] marked my second year at this, and I even got to mentor a 'new kid', which opened up a whole new world of stress for me," Inafune recounted. The development time for the game was only three to four months.[2][1</p>

			<p>Though the first Mega Man game had relatively low sales, Mega Man 2 was a huge success. Since its 1988 release, Mega Man 2 has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide. The game is the highest selling in the Mega Man series and is Capcom's 30th highest selling title.[31] Mega Man 2 was critically praised by critics. Electronic Gaming Monthly's four reviewers—Steve Harris, Ed Semrad, Donn Nauert, and Jim Allee—rated the game favorably. They stated that it was better than the first Mega Man, citing the improved audio-visuals, new power-ups, and password system. Nauert and Allee, however, expressed disappointment that the game was less difficult than the first game.[27] Nadia Oxford of 1UP.com complimented its aesthetics and gameplay. She further stated that Mega Man 2 improved the gameplay of its predecessor by removing excessively difficult elements.[16] Mean Machines' two reviewers, Julian Rignall and Matt Regan, praised several aspects of the game. Rignall lauded the gameplay, citing its addictiveness and the puzzles. Regan praised the difficulty and called the gameplay balanced. Both reviewers complimented the graphics, calling them detailed and stunning, and described it as a great platform game.[3] Retro Gamer editor Richard Burton described it as a "must-have" title for the system, comments echoed by two of Electronic Gaming Monthly's reviewers.[27][32] Zach Miller writing for Game Informer attributed the success of the game to the players' option to defeat the stages in the order of their choosing. He praised the simple control scheme and the variety of weapons and items.[33] GamesRadar ranked it the second-best NES game ever made, calling it "the pinnacle" of the 8-bit Mega Man games.[34]</p>
