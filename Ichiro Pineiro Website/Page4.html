			<p>Despite the strong sales of the game, Kitamura chose to leave Capcom instead of working on the sequel Mega Man 3. Ozaki cites the disagreement between Kitamura and Fujiwara as the reason why Kitamura left Capcom. Instead, Kitamura, along with former Capcom planners Shin'ichi Yoshimoto, and Kouichi Yotsui formed a new company, named Takeru. Kitamura's last titles as a game director were Cocoron and Nontan to Issho: Kuru Kuru Puzzle as well as uncredited work for various titles before leaving the video game industry.[49]

Keiji Inafune claims the success of Mega Man 2 is what made the Mega Man series a hit that continues to spawn sequels.[12] 1UP.com commented that the game helped establish the series as a prominent and commercially successful video game franchise.[41] IGN cited Mega Man 2 as a title that helped define the action-platforming genre.[23] Retro Gamer credited it with helping the series obtain the global presence that allowed spin-offs and more sequels to be created.[9] Many of the conventions of the original Mega Man series were defined by the first title, but Mega Man 2 added crucial conventions that were retained for the rest of the series.[9][29] The traditional number of Robot Masters for the series is eight as used in Mega Man 2, rather than the six used in the original.[17][23][29] It was the first in the series to include an opening cinematic.[35] Mega Man 2 also introduced the Energy Tank item, special movement items, teleporter room, and password system, which became staples in future titles.[23][29] The Energy Tank became the series' iconic health refill item and later served as inspiration for a promotional "Rockman E-Can" drink.[50] In developing Mega Man 9, producer Inafune and Hironobu Takeshita looked to the first two games in the series for inspiration, with Mega Man 2 serving as a standard to surpass in order to meet fans' expectations.[17][40] Mega Man Universe was to feature a remake of Mega Man 2's story campaign, as well as feature customizable characters and levels.[51] However, Capcom has officially announced the game's cancellation due to "various circumstances." [52] In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Wily Castle, as depicted in Mega Man 2, appears as a selectable stage in both versions of the game.</p>

			<p>Introduced in the first Mega Man game, Wily was Dr. Light's partner and friend, and helped him create a series of humanoid robots to help mankind, though the world ignored his contribution. Jealous, he reprogrammed the robots for combat, seeking to use them as weapons to assist him in taking over the world, with the exception of the childlike robots Rock and Roll. However, he was defeated by Rock, now converted into the combat robot "Mega Man". Wily returned as the antagonist of subsequent titles in the main series with a different scheme each time,[5][6] sometimes framing someone else for his crimes (Dr. Cossack, Proto Man, a disguise for himself named Mr. X, and Dr. Light), only to be defeated and surrender to Mega Man at the end.[7] Wily is also responsible for the creation of several other characters throughout the series, including Bass and Zero,[8] and is indirectly responsible for the behaviour of the antagonist of the Mega Man X series, Sigma, during that series.[9]</p>
